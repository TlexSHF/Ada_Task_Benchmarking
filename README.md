# Ada_Task_Benchmarking
A simple tasking-program written in Ada for managing task sets and benchmarking them, validating the real time system

✅ Getting tasking to work <br>
✅ Calculate computation time C for each task <br>
⬛ Fetch the period T and priority P for each task <br>
⬛ Create a Task Set Table with C, T and P <br>
⬛ Calculate the utilization U for all tasks in the Task Set Table, and add it to the table <br>
